# Alembic Exporter for Maya

## Description
This tool provides an interface in Maya for exporting selected geometry objects with the "_GEO" suffix to an Alembic cache. It also includes options to generate a playblast and automatically open the output folder after export. The tool ensures that only valid task files are processed based on specific directory structure rules.

## Features
- Export selected geometry objects with "_GEO" suffix to Alembic cache
- Option to generate playblast
- Automatically open the output folder after export
- Validates task files based on directory structure

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Maya installed with PySide2 and shiboken2 available.
3. Place the `alembic_exporter.py` script in your desired directory.
4. Update the path in the shelf button script to point to your `alembic_exporter.py` directory.

## Usage
1. **Setup the Shelf Button in Maya:**
   - Create a new shelf button in Maya.
   - Use the following Python code for the shelf button:

     ```python
     import sys
     import os
     import maya.cmds as cmds

     # Path to the directory containing the alembic_exporter.py script
     script_dir = "C:/Users/srchr/Documents/PRTTM/AnimationPublisher/src"  # Update this to your actual script directory

     if script_dir not in sys.path:
         sys.path.append(script_dir)

     try:
         import importlib
         import alembic_exporter as ae
         importlib.reload(ae)  # For Python 3
         ae.AlembicExporter().show()
     except ImportError as e:
         cmds.warning("Failed to import the script. Check the script directory path.")
         print(str(e))
     except Exception as e:
         cmds.warning("An error occurred: {}".format(str(e)))
         print(str(e))
     ```

2. **Running the Tool:**
   - Click the shelf button to open the Alembic Exporter interface.
   - Select the geometry objects to export.
   - Check or uncheck the "Generate Playblast" option.
   - Click the "Submit" button to start the export process.

## Environment Detection
The tool uses Python and PySide2 for the GUI and works within the Maya environment. It adapts to the file paths and structures expected in a typical Maya project setup.

## Components
- **AlembicExporter Class**: The main class that provides the GUI and handles the export logic.
- **derive_output_path Function**: Derives the output path for the Alembic cache based on the scene file's directory structure.
- **get_maya_window Function**: Retrieves the Maya main window for parent-child relationship in the GUI.

## Extending the Manager
To extend the tool:
1. Add new features in the `alembic_exporter.py` script.
2. Ensure new functionalities adhere to the existing structure and follow best practices for Maya scripting.
3. Update the README with instructions for new features.

## Contributing
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3. Commit your changes and push the branch to your fork.
4. Submit a pull request with a detailed description of your changes.
